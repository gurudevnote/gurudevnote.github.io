MyGeneration software is a great sofware to create and run templates for generating source code from database model like Codesmith. It is open source software and [it's source code](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mygeneration/) is placed on sourceforge website. But the source code is no longer updeted, so i fork the source code to my github repository and make some changens to fix bug and some features. I created [a template to generate joomla 3.5 component](https://github.com/nguyenhuuhuy/joomlatool.git) from database by using my fork.
